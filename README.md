# Create - Refabricated

## About

This project intends to port the Create mod to Fabric. All help is welcome, this is not going to be easy.
The entirety(?) of Create has already been remapped from MCP to Yarn, and other important files have been moved too. now it's time to fix everything else. 

## Contributing
Cut (yes, cut. not copy.) and paste a file or set of files from "oh god dont open this folder" into src. Fix errors and PR.
Keep your code and organization consistent with the original mod. Only exception is comments - please comment everything.
note: build.gradle.old and gradle.properties.old are the files from the original mod unchanged. 

## Development Roadmap 
I'm starting with the basics. literally. Stuff from create.content.contraptions.base needs to come first, everything relies on that.
