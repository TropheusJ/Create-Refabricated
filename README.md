# Kinetic API

## About

This project is the kinetics of the Create mod separated from the content and ported to fabric for all to use.\
A large part of Create has already been remapped from MCP to Yarn, and other important files have been moved too. now it's time to fix everything else. 

## Contributing
**All contributions are welcome.** \
Move a file or set of files from "the old files" into src. Fix errors and PR.\
This project is for the kinetics, no content will be in this. That's going in a separate repo somewhere down the line. \
Try to keep your code and organization consistent with the original mod. See Development Roadmap for why this might be difficult.\
Please comment everything that isn't self-explanatory. \
note: build.gradle.old and gradle.properties.old are the files from the original mod unchanged. 

## Development Roadmap 
The regular mod is going to be split into multiple for this port. This repo is for the rotation and contraption API/engine/whatever it is. No content.\
This project is going to take *ages* without external help. All contributions are welcome.
